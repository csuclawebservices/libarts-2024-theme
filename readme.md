# Libarts 2024 Theme
The block theme for all College of Liberal Arts websites that implements the ["Find Your Energy" brand](https://brand.colostate.edu). It fully implements the WordPress Editor (styles, presets, patterns, templates, etc) and utilizes the Block Editor for building site content. Though it's not a strict dependency it heavily relies on the custom blocks provided by the CLA Blocks plugin.

Note that this is still in early development and breaking changes are likely with future releases.
